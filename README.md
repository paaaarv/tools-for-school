# tools-for-school
  Rails Portfolio Project - app for users to donate money towards supplies that teachers may need for their classrooms.
  On the other hand, a way for teachers to be able to add supplies that they need funds for.


#Getting Started

  Once you clone and download, you must first run bundle install in your terminal in order to install all the gems I used in creating this app.

  Then, rake db:migrate must be run in order to get database information, and rake db:seed for the seeded information(categories) that I have already added onto my project.


  After this you can run rails s on your terminal to see the app in action!
